## Feature
Getting tired of seeing Visual Studio code editor tooltips when you're presenting?  They flash immediately when you're moving your mouse.  Very distracting for you and your viewers.

This extension "Tames" the Visual Studio 2017 & 2019 code editor Tooltips by not showing them unless the LEFT CTRL key or LEFT SHIFT is depressed and the user hovers over the object.  

### Building
The project was built using Visual Studio 2019.
